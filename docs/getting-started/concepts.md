# Key Concepts

Understanding these foundational concepts will help you make the most of the Knowledge Base.

## Knowledge Organization

### Categories
Content is organized into logical categories. Each category groups related topics together for easier discovery.

### Tags
Tags provide cross-cutting labels that connect related content across different categories.

### Hierarchy
Content follows a hierarchy from general to specific:
- **Section** → **Category** → **Topic** → **Subtopic**

## Content Types

### Documentation
Explanatory content that covers the "what" and "why" of topics. Good for understanding concepts.

### Guides
Procedural content that covers the "how" of tasks. Step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific goals.

### Reference
Quick-lookup content like glossaries, FAQs, and checklists. Good for finding specific information fast.

## Best Practices for Using This Knowledge Base

1. **Search First** - The search is powerful; use it before browsing
2. **Follow Links** - Related content is hyperlinked; explore connections
3. **Check Dates** - Note when content was last updated
4. **Provide Feedback** - Help improve the knowledge base by reporting issues
